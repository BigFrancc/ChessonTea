# SimpleToken Solidity Smart Contract

SimpleToken is a basic Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity that implements a simple token with transfer functionality.

## Features

- **Token Name**: The contract allows you to set the name of the token.
- **Token Symbol**: You can define the symbol (ticker) of the token.
- **Decimal Units**: Define the number of decimal units for the token.
- **Initial Supply**: Upon deployment, you can specify the initial supply of tokens.
- **Transfer Functionality**: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Contract**: Use a Solidity compiler to compile the SimpleToken.sol contract.
2. **Deploy to TEA Protocol**: Deploy the compiled contract to the TEA Protocol blockchain using appropriate tools.
3. **Interact with the Contract**: Once deployed, users can interact with the contract by calling its functions, such as transferring tokens.

## Example Deployment

```bash
